Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming that refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same method or property in different ways. To demonstrate polymorphism in the code you provided, you could define a method that can be used in different ways depending on the type of object it is called on.

For example, you could define a getInfo method that returns different information depending on whether it is called on a User, Tutor, or Learnableobject. my code shows how to do it:




There are several reasons why you might use polymorphism in your code:

Code reuse: Polymorphism allows you to reuse a single method or property in multiple classes, which can reduce duplication and make your code easier to maintain.

Flexibility: By using polymorphism, you can create more flexible and modular code that can respond to the same method or property in different ways depending on the context. This can make your code more adaptable to change and easier to extend.

Readability: Polymorphism can make your code more readable by allowing you to define methods or properties in a way that is more intuitive and expressive. This can make it easier for other developers to understand and work with your code.

Extensibility: Polymorphism can make it easier to add new functionality to your code by allowing you to create new classes that extend or modify existing ones. This can help you create more flexible and scalable systems over time.

Overall, polymorphism is a useful technique that can help you create more flexible, maintainable, and scalable code, and it is an important concept to understand when working with object-oriented programming languages.
