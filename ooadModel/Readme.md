As a student of learnable using teachable this is my Learning Management System (LMS) or E-Learning service, that lets users(people) subscribe or be gifted a course prepared(uploaded, taught) by a tutor or a business. You will apply all the lessons learned about Object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD), like identifying cases, scenarios and actors, and ultimately draw up a UML model for your E-Learning service. You can use teachable.com as your case study. Your model/design needs to capture a simple MVP of your case study.

The output of your OOAD activities must include class and use-case diagrams, among others, if any.
